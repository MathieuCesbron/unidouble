An e-commerce platform stored on a blockchain has these characteristics compared to traditional e-commerce website:

1. Full privacy of users
2. No blacklisting of users and items sold
3. No data collected
4. Removes predatory dark patterns
5. All the money made by the e-commerce is available for items delivery or for charity

The objective of Unidouble is to be a better version of Ebay.
